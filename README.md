Hi, I'm Iniye! I'm currently a junior studying Statistics and Data Science at Yale University. I'm still deciding what I want to specialize in within those fields, but I'm currently intrested in data engineering, natural language processing, and machine learning. I'm spending this summer (2025) reviewing and formalizing my tech stack and working on fun projects personal to me. If you have any advice about languages/programs/skils to learn or advice about the order I'm learning in please let me know!

currently learning: git and github
current project: setting up my github!

latest completed project: TBD :)

currently reading: between the world and me (ta-nehisi coates)

tech stack: python (numpy, pandas), r, bash, sql, matlab, c
